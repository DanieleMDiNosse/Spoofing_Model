# Spoofing Model in High Frequency Markets
In this repository I will try to implement and possibly improve the spoofng model presented in the work by Xuan Tao, Andrew Day, Lan Link and Samuel Drapeau (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14818v2.pdf). The main idea of the paper is to monitor the spoofing activity
exploiting the average cost of it (and hence its convencience) that can be used to compute the imbalance between bid and ask size in the presence and absence of spoofing.
